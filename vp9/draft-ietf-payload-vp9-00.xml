    <abstract>
      <t>This memo describes an RTP payload format for the VP9 video codec.
      The payload format has wide applicability, as it supports applications
      from low bit-rate peer-to-peer usage, to high bit-rate video
      conferences.  It includes provisions for temporal and spatial scalability.</t>

      <t>This memo describes an RTP payload specification applicable to the
      transmission of video streams encoded using the VP9 video codec <xref
      target="I-D.grange-vp9-bitstream"/>. The format described in this document can be used
      both in peer-to-peer and video conferencing applications.</t>

      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119"/>.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="mediaFormatDescription" title="Media Format Description">
      <t>The VP9 codec can maintain up to eight reference frames, of
      which up to three can be referenced or updated by any new frame.</t>

      <t>VP9 also allows a reference frame to be resampled and used as a
      reference for another frame of a different resolution.  This
      allows internal resolution changes without requiring the use of
      key frames.</t>

      <t>These features together enable an encoder to
      implement various forms of coarse-grained scalability,
      including temporal, spatial and quality scalability modes, as
      well as combinations of these, without the need for explicit
      scalable coding tools.</t>

      <t>Temporal layers define different frame rates of video;
      spatial and quality layers define different and possibly dependent
      representations of a single input frame.  Spatial layers allow
      a frame to be encoded at different resolutions, whereas
      quality layers allow a frame to be encoded at the same
      resolution but at different qualities (and thus with different
      amounts of coding error).  VP9 supports quality layers as
      spatial layers without any resolution changes; hereinafter,
      the term "spatial layer" is used to represent both spatial and
      quality layers.</t>

      <t>This payload format specification defines how such
      temporal and spatial scalability layers can be described and communicated.</t>

      <t>Layers are designed (and MUST be encoded) such that if
      any layer, and all higher layers, are removed from the bitstream
      along any of the two dimensions, the remaining bitstream is
      still correctly decodable.</t>

      <t>For terminology, this document uses the term "layer frame" to refer
      to a single encoded VP9 frame for a particular resolution/quality, and
      "super frame" to refer to all the representations (layer frames) at a single
      instant in time.  A super frame thus consists of one or more layer frames,
      encoding different spatial layers.</t>

      <t>Within a super frame, a layer frame with spatial layer ID equal to S,
      where S > 0, can depend on a frame with a lower spatial layer ID.  This
      "inter-layer" dependency results in additional coding  gain to the
      traditional "inter-picture" dependency, where a frame depends on previously
      coded frame in time.  For simplicity, this payload format assumes that,
      within a super frame if inter-layer dependency is used, a spatial layer S frame
      can only depend on spatial layer S-1 frame when S > 0.  Additionally, if
      inter-picture dependency is used, spatial layer S frame is assumed to only
      depend on prevously coded spatial layer S frame.</t>

      <t>TODO: Describe how simulcast can be supported?</t>

      <t>Given above simplifications for inter-layer and inter-picture
      dependencies, a flag (the D bit described below) is used to indicate whether a
      spatial layer S frame depends on spatial layer S-1 frame.  Then a receiver
      only needs to know the inter-picture dependency structure for a given
      spatial layer frame in order to determine its decodability.  Two modes
      of describing the inter-picture dependency structure are possible:
      "flexible mode" and "non-flexible mode".  An encoder can only switch
      between the two on the very first packet of a key frame with temporal 
      layer ID equal to 0.  </t>

      <t>In flexible mode, each packet can contain up to 3 reference
      indices, which identifies all frames referenced by the frame
      transmitted in the current packet for inter-picture prediction. 
      This (along with the D bit) enables a receiver to identify if a frame 
      is decodable or not and helps it understand the temporal layer structure 
      so that it can drop packets as it sees fit. Since this is signaled in 
      each packet it makes it possible to have very flexible temporal layer
      hierarchies and patterns which are changing dynamically.</t>

      <t>In non-flexible mode, the inter-picture dependency (the reference
      indices) of a group of frames (GOF) MUST be pre-specified as part of the 
      scalability structure (SS) data.  In this mode, each packet will have 
      an index to refer to one of the described frames, from which the
      frames referenced by the frame transmitted in the current packet 
      for inter-picture prediction can be identified.</t>

      <t>The SS data can also be used to specify the resolution of each
      spatial layer present in the VP9 stream.</t>

          group of frames index (GOF_IDX) is specified, which can be used to obtain the 
          values of T and U fields from the scalable structure (SS) data described below.
          An additional octet to represent the temporal layer 0 index, TL0PICIDX, is present 
          so that all minimally required frames can be tracked.</t>

          <t>The T and S fields, whether obtained directly or indirectly from the SS data,
          indicate the temporal and spatial layers and can help MCUs measure bitrates 
          per layer and can help them make a quick decision on whether to relay a packet 
          or not.  They can also help receivers determine what layers they are currently
          decoding.

            layer frames will not depend on any frame before the current frame (in coding time) with temporal layer
            ID greater than T.</t>

            the U fields are derived from the SS data.  Additionally, the frame's inter-picture dependecy can also be
            obtained from the SS data.  In the case no SS data has been received or the received SS data
            does not specify GOF (N_G is set to 0), then GOF_IDX MUST be ignored and the stream is assumed to

      <t>The VP9 payload descriptor defined in <xref
      target="VP9payloadDescriptor"/> above contains an optional PictureID
      parameter. One use of this parameter is included to enable use of reference
      picture selection index (RPSI) and slice loss indication (SLI), both
      defined in <xref target="RFC4585"/>.</t>

      <section anchor="RPSI" title="RPSI">
		<t>TODO: Update to indicate which frame within the picture.</t>
        <t>The reference picture selection index is a payload-specific
        feedback message defined within the RTCP-based feedback format. The
        RPSI message is generated by a receiver and can be used in two ways.
        Either it can signal a preferred reference picture when a loss has
        been detected by the decoder -- preferably then a reference that the
        decoder knows is perfect -- or, it can be used as positive feedback
        information to acknowledge correct decoding of certain reference
        pictures. The positive feedback method is useful for VP9 used as
        unicast. The use of RPSI for VP9 is preferably combined with a special
        update pattern of the codec's two special reference frames -- the
        golden frame and the altref frame -- in which they are updated in an
        alternating leapfrog fashion. When a receiver has received and
        correctly decoded a golden or altref frame, and that frame had a
        PictureID in the payload descriptor, the receiver can acknowledge this
        simply by sending an RPSI message back to the sender. The message body
        (i.e., the "native RPSI bit string" in <xref target="RFC4585"/>) is
        simply the PictureID of the received frame.</t>
      </section>

      <section anchor="SLI" title="SLI">
		<t>TODO: Update to indicate which frame within the picture.</t>
        <t>The slice loss indication is another payload-specific feedback
        message defined within the RTCP-based feedback format. The SLI message
        is generated by the receiver when a loss or corruption is detected in
        a frame. The format of the SLI message is as follows <xref
        target="RFC4585"/>:</t>

        <t>Here, First is the macroblock address (in scan order) of the first
        lost block and Number is the number of lost blocks. PictureID is the
        six least significant bits of the codec-specific picture identifier in
        which the loss or corruption has occurred. For VP9, this
        codec-specific identifier is naturally the PictureID of the current
        frame, as read from the payload descriptor. If the payload descriptor
        of the current frame does not have a PictureID, the receiver MAY send
        the last received PictureID+1 in the SLI message. The receiver MAY set
        the First parameter to 0, and the Number parameter to the total number
        of macroblocks per frame, even though only parts of the frame is
        corrupted. When the sender receives an SLI message, it can make use of
        the knowledge from the latest received RPSI message. Knowing that the
        last golden or altref frame was successfully received, it can encode
        the next frame with reference to that established reference.</t>

      <section title="Example">
		<t>TODO: this example is copied from the VP8 payload format specification,
		and has not been updated for VP9.  It may be incorrect.</t>

        <t>The use of RPSI and SLI is best illustrated in an example. In this
        example, the encoder may not update the altref frame until the last
        sent golden frame has been acknowledged with an RPSI message. If an
        update is not received within some time, a new golden frame update is
        sent instead. Once the new golden frame is established and
        acknowledged, the same rule applies when updating the altref
        frame.</t>

              <t>The encoding name in the "a=rtpmap" line of SDP MUST be VP9

    <section anchor="securityConsiderations" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>RTP packets using the payload format defined in this specification
      are subject to the security considerations discussed in the RTP
      specification <xref target="RFC3550"/>, and in any applicable RTP
      profile. The main security considerations for the RTP packet carrying
      the RTP payload format defined within this memo are confidentiality,
      integrity and source authenticity. Confidentiality is achieved by
      encryption of the RTP payload. Integrity of the RTP packets through
      suitable cryptographic integrity protection mechanism. Cryptographic
      system may also allow the authentication of the source of the payload. A
      suitable security mechanism for this RTP payload format should provide
      confidentiality, integrity protection and at least source authentication
      capable of determining if an RTP packet is from a member of the RTP
      session or not. Note that the appropriate mechanism to provide security
      to RTP and payloads following this memo may vary. It is dependent on the
      application, the transport, and the signaling protocol employed.
      Therefore a single mechanism is not sufficient, although if suitable the
      usage of SRTP <xref target="RFC3711"/> is recommended. This RTP payload
      format and its media decoder do not exhibit any significant
      non-uniformity in the receiver-side computational complexity for packet
      processing, and thus are unlikely to pose a denial-of-service threat due
      to the receipt of pathological data. Nor does the RTP payload format
      contain any active content.</t>

    <section anchor="congestionControl" title="Congestion Control">
      <t>Congestion control for RTP SHALL be used in accordance with RFC 3550
      <xref target="RFC3550"/>, and with any applicable RTP profile; e.g., RFC
      3551 <xref target="RFC3551"/>. The congestion control mechanism can, in
      a real-time encoding scenario, adapt the transmission rate by
      instructing the encoder to encode at a certain target rate. Media aware
      network elements MAY use the information in the VP9 payload descriptor
      in <xref target="VP9payloadDescriptor"/> to identify non-reference
      frames and discard them in order to reduce network congestion. Note that
      discarding of non-reference frames cannot be done if the stream is
      encrypted (because the non-reference marker is encrypted).</t>
